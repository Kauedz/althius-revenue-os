# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading
- Each ticket lists what it may touch (`## Pode mexer`) and what it must not (`## Não mexa`); touching anything else needs the user's go-ahead first
- A ticket with a `## Passos do Nan` section needs human action (db push, deploy, secret, external account, visual check with real credentials). The agent running it must tell the user exactly what to do, with ready PowerShell commands, or run `/wizard` when there are many steps, before calling the ticket done; it never skips a manual step, never asks for keys or passwords in chat, and never runs on the remote project what belongs to the user
- Platform-wide rules: `AGENTS.md` (regras inegociáveis) e as ADRs em `docs/adr/`. Cada ticket que muda banco, segredo ou servidor também segue a regra de `AGENTS.md` de rodar `npm run verificar` antes de commitar.
- Cada PR resolve um ticket; o ticket guarda o link do PR em `## Comments` quando fecha.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` (creating the directory if needed).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket.

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md` (the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body).
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
